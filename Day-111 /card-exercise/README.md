You have to use an api and display the data in the form of card under a container.All the data points returned by the api should be converted to a card.
Use this API : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Hint: 
Create a state for the data which will be fetched using the Json Placeholder API 
Inside useEffect, use fetch to populate that state and then use map to render that state
